**AI & Software Engineer | CU Boulder '26**  
I’m a Computer Science student at the **University of Colorado Boulder** graduating in **May 2026**, specializing in **Artificial Intelligence** and **Software Engineering**. My research dives into **probabilistic programming** and **reachability analysis**, hybrid dynamical systems. I love turning theoretical concepts into real-world solutions—whether it’s deploying ML models or building scalable software.  

**What I Bring to the Table**:  
- 🤖 **AI/ML**: Hands-on experience with **NLP, computer vision, and probabilistic models** (PyTorch/TensorFlow).  
- 🌐 **Full-Stack Development**: Built apps using **Flask, Java, Rust**, and cloud platforms (**AWS/GCP**).  
- 🛠️ **Engineering Rigor**: Advocate for **clean code, CI/CD pipelines, and Agile workflows**.  

**Beyond the Screen**:  
- 🏢 **Collaborator**: Thrive in hackathons, research labs, and team-driven environments.  
- 🏋️ **Athlete & Drummer**: Fueled by workouts, sports, and dreams of drumming on a world stage!
